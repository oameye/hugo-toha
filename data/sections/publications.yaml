  paper:
    summary: This study explores the control of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) networks under external force, demonstrating how the force influences the system's configuration, akin to a magnetic field biasing a spin ensemble. The findings provide a method to create Ising machines with arbitrary bias, extending to cases unachievable in real spin systems.

  paper:
    summary: We study how a driven low-frequency mode couples with an undriven high-frequency mode in a membrane system, creating phononic frequency combs through limit cycles. Using a pump-noisy-probe technique, we show that blue-detuned sidebands attract to the high mode and merge at Hopf bifurcations, revealing the microscopic origin of frequency comb formation with applications in sensing and phononic metamaterials.

- title: The parametric instability landscape of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators
  publishedIn:
    name: arXiv:2501.08793

  paper:
    summary: We study networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) and map their stability regions using secular perturbation theory. Starting with two coupled KPOs, we show how bifurcations arise from competition between parametric drive and linear coupling. We extend this to larger all-to-all coupled networks, finding that bifurcation transitions become uniformly spaced in the thermodynamic limit. Our results define the precise bounds where KPO networks behave like Ising models, providing guidance for experimental implementation.

  paper:
    summary: We demonstrate how three strongly coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) can simulate Ising Hamiltonians and estimate ground states using Boltzmann sampling. The work addresses challenges in KPO networks where complex phase diagrams can produce unsuitable states for analog optimization, providing a pathway for classical analog computation with relevance to quantum coherent state systems.
